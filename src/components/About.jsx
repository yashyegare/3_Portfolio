        Hey there! I'm a software developer with over a year of experience in crafting robust and user-friendly web applications. My coding journey started back in college when I began tinkering with Java programs, and now it's developed into a full-fledged career that keeps me curious and excited every day.<br />
        <br />

        I really enjoy working with frameworks like React, Node.js, and Django. I've got a knack for developing scalable and modular components, which really streamline our development workflows and make everything seamless.I've also dabbled in projects involving Machine Learning and MLOps, diving into the world of Google Cloud and AWS.<br />
        <br />

        Recently, I've been dipping my toes into the realms of Open Source and DevOps. These areas have captured my interest because they offer such exciting possibilities. I'm still learning, but I'm genuinely intrigued by all the potential they hold.<br />
        <br />
        
        I'm thrilled to keep coding, exploring new technologies, and pushing my boundaries!<br />
